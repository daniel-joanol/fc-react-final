# First Commit - Open Bootcamp
This is is my first Full Stack project. The goal is to create a web page similar to the one in OpenBootcamp where you can register or modify the data of the students looking for a job opportunity. 

In this project I used Java/Spring, JavaScript/React, HTML/CSS/Bootstrap
